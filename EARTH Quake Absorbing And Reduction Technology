History:
From the beginning of the world, we human beings are facing various

kinds difficulties because of natural disaster.Earthquake is one of the

most vital problem amongst them.we,the greatest creature of God, are

helpless against the Earthquake.We have found no other solution in order

that we can face this at least having no loses.
There is a good

reason of why not we are finding any solution.Because we always are

looking to stop it instead of taking any remedy.But we always forget

that none of us can change the will of God as much as we want to till He

wants to change it.
Incident that inspired us:

After the tragic earthquake of Nepal, April 25,2015,which is measured 7.8 magnitude in Richter scale, depth 8.2 kilometer,losing approximately 10 billion $ and about being 3.5 million people homeless.That’s where we are thinking of working on it.
An way to solution:

To solve this problem,we worked on it and developed a special building

structure adding some special features so that no more building collapse

due to shaking of earthquake.we named our project

Earth-QART(Earth-Quake Absorbing & Reduction Technology).

Earthquakes are usually caused when rock underground suddenly breaks

along a fault. This sudden release of energy causes the seismic waves

that make the ground shake. When two blocks of rock or two plates are

rubbing against each other, they stick a little. They don't just slide

smoothly; the rocks catch on each other. The rocks are still pushing

against each other, but not moving. After a while, the rocks break

because of all the pressure that's built up. When the rocks break, the

earthquake occurs.
Our thought to prevent this disaster:

In order to solve this,we use some special features in building structure.
# Gimbal
# Hydraulic Base
# Sensor

Gimbals are the main structural part of our innovation.we connect four

gimbals with the four major pillars of the building.Gimblas are made

following the simple law of 3 dimensional axis of physics so it can move

any side in accordance with its need based on the earthquake direction

keeping the building fixed and free from shaking.Gimbals are attached

with building following the ratio (6.5-7.5) : (3.5-2.5).this gimbal is

capable of tolerating 12 magnitude earthquake.It is such kind of

equation that is polynomialy developed for every size of the building.

Hydraulic Base is another important feature of our structure.Basically

our building is made on hydraulic basement instead of using soil unlike

other normal typical building.Here we use the law of Hydraulic Press of

physics in our basement.when earthquake is sensed,this base

automatically will push itself down and building will be hang up with

gimbals so that all the shaking attacks the gimbal but building.Then

after the earthquake hydraulic base will pull itself up.
Sensor is

the last special feature that we add in our structure. New sensor

technologies have greatly reduced the cost of lower-resolution strong

motion seismometers. These sensors use micro-electro-mechanical systems

(MEMS) accelerometers that are contained on a single computer chip.Those

sensors will have connected a central reserve and processing system. As

well as earth quake come sensor sense the shock and send a signal to

the center. And center will run a mechanical system that pull down the

hydraulic base.we set this sensor under the 200 meter to 2 kilometer of

the ground which covers 15-20 kilometers of area and it will provide

sense 4 seconds before earthquake happening.
A key algorithm to the solution:

We have an Algorithm.

Step 1: set the Gimbals basement pillar

Step 2: set the Hydraulic Basement

Step 3: connect building and Gimbals basement pillar with Gimbals (Connection ratio (6.5-7.5) : (3.5-2.5).

Step 4: Make sensors functional and connect with Hydraulic Basement and Alarm systems
The reason behind to the adaptation of this plan:

It is matter of great happiness that our building costs less compared to

normal building.In normal building all the pillars must have basement

that causes a big mount of cost but in our structure only four gimbal

pillar must have basement.So we can avoid unusual cost.
At present

NASA have the sensor of detecting earthquake that approximately response

before 20 seconds of happening of earthquake.If NASA allows us to use

their data,our innovation has a great future that can widen the way of

out improvement by doing minimum lives lost,minimum damage.
